        <h3>Cereals are processed grains from which the inedible parts are removed and some of these are broken into small pieces. Cereals are rich in carbohydrates, vitamins, protein, minerals, and many other nutrients. The term cereal was derived from Ceres, who is the Roman goddess of agriculture.</h3>
